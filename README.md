### Implementing a REST application based on SpringBoot

You can use the (bit old) video tutorial developed by Niclas Polkow as a first starting point on how to use the SpringBoot platform (together with Sprint Initializer): <br>

A more recent and official tutorial on how to create a REST application (rather: a service) with SpringBoot can be found here: <br>
https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/

On top, you should see this description on how to integrating MongoDB into a SpringBoot application:<br>
https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-mongodb/

Please test your REST service with the Postman tool, which can be obtained for various operating systems:<br>

In the Postman tool, do also integrate the authentication mechanisms accordingly! For bearer authentication, you should use variables, which allow to share the tokens that are typically obtained during a bearer authentication. More information on variables can be found here:<br>
https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#sharing-and-persisting-data


Please do also provide a documentation of your REST-based service by means of the tool Swagger:<br>

An introduction on how to integrate Swagger in your application based on SpringBoot is given here:<br>
